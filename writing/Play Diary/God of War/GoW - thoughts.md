# Thoughts and notes on God of War

## Themes

*Kratos is a shit dad and the game doesn't seem that interested in mkaing him better at this*

Kratos, despite everything, is still an ass. He treats Atreus like shit, bordering on abuse (maybe even going into abuse territory, I'm not an expert on the subject). The game seems aware of this, but when atreus brings up that his dad is absent, emotionally unavailable, and all in all kinda garbage, he gets defensive and justifies himself by saying, basically, "you don't what i've been through, don't judge". And the game seems to agreee! "Kratos is a complex guy, he's been through stuff, it's normal he's like this..." etc. The game seems to excuse Kratos for being garbage with his kid.

Ther are moments where we can see that it's not quite what the game wants to communicate about him though. Those moments wher kratos starts to reach to put his hands on atreus' shoulder to comfort him, but pulls his hand ecause he does'nt want to be vulnerable are realy great. You really get the sense that he wants to open up but finds himself unable to. 

But, kratos being kratos, he also still carries a toxic expression of masculinity, thought it shifted from rage and violence to stoicism and emotionnal unavailability. Whan atreus first kills a human, all kratos has to say to comfort him is "close your heart to it". He dosen't try to understand or emphathize with his son, instead saying -gently, granted, but firmly- that his 13-something kid shouldn't consider the people he's killing like human beings with thoughts and emotions and that it's no big deal if they die. 

I'm still getting through the game though, it could change for the better in the latter half of the story. i really hope so, this game is really good overall, it'd be too bad if it fell short of what it's trying to do!


## Levelling system

*The RPG system is deep but a bit complex and unintuitive at first.*

The menu is super dense, ther's a lot of things going on at every level : weapons have levels, slots for runic attacks, for enchantments, armor also has levels, and slots for other stuff, then there's the skill trees, theres like 6 of them
there's also a "level" like number on the right of the screen above stats that are not clear in what they mean. The level doesn't seem to be affected by the XP, rather it looks like it's a sum of the stats.

This is all a complicated mess that you learn to sort out over the course of the game. It has advantages, mainly to offer depth (for example : as weird as the XP being a resource that you spend is to the average player, it offers designers much more granularity in balancing the cost of skills. They maybe should have found a better name for it ? it reminds me of the souls in the souls game.) 

There a fuckton of different resources used for crafting as well
