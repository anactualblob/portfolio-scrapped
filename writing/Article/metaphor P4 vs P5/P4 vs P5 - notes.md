# From Persona 4 to Persona 5 : evolution of metaphor -- Notes

## Persona 4 : the metaphor

your friends fight your shadow when it gets out of control, then you confront it and accept it. It becomes a persona , that you use to fight "common" shadows (they are supposed to be shadows common to a lot of people I guess ? It's not clear or it was explained at the start of the game and I'm fuzzy on the details).

so the metaphor goes : shadow emerges from your repressed desires/feelings, your friends fight it, you confront it and accept it 
    -> it becomes your persona, which is your weapon
    you use your persona to fight the shadows

=> confronting your repressed desires allows you to "take on" the world better : knowing yourself makes you better, and your friends help you confront those desires



## Persona 5 : the metaphor

the bad guys have shadows now, and they are the manifestations of the twisted desires that overtook the bad guy. Characters gain personas when they rebel against the shadow.
the persona manifests as a voice inside the character's head, commenting that they were waiting to be awakened ? so the persona was always here but awakens only when rebelling. The character now has a mask stuck to their face, and the persona actually awakens when they rip it off. 
Which begs the question : the concept of a *persona* is that of a mask that you wear out in the world to shield your true self ; so the mask is the physical representation of a character's persona. Which begs the question, did they not have it before ? Except they did since the persona says that they were wating to be awakened. My take is that they always wore the mask, but they weren't conscieous of it, so it was invisible. When they rebel, the mask is made apparent, because they becom aware of their persona. When they rip the mask off, it signals that they have gained control of their persona. 

also worth noting, the masks are symbols of their personas, as it's what they rip off to awaken it. They are ostensibly wearing thoses masks when in a palace. 

when the persona awakens, they also gain new clothes, but that may not be core to the metaphor.


--- 

the game does have these overarching themes of rebellion, but also muddled with a metaphor about rehabilitation ? and the velvet room is a prison ? so the rehabilitation is actually rebelling ? weird.
it's very clearly interested in pitting the young main characters against "shitty adults" as per Ryuji's words, with their personas being famous "rebels" (arsene lupin, captain kidd, zorro, etc.) and the gang being named "phantom thieves" and protrayed as robin hood-type figures.

---

worth noting: in this game, the monsters are not shadows, they are "corrupted" personas. I think this strengthens the metaphor, but it's not that relevant to the themes of the game (aside from the fact that you can make them turn on the palace's owner, make them rebel if you will)

all in all :

=> rebelling allows you to become conscious of the way you interact with the world. When aware of it, you can control it, which makes you more apt to face the world.
